IBM -> OpenStack based possibly, so it seems I could use the bluemix platform, for possible deployments, on top of this the data analytics side would be easily dealt with on the cloud

Analytics side for sure, need to chat and see if openstack deployment of cloud instances is the same though.

It turns out that you do not have availability to the bare compute level stuff which means that I won't have access to this either. But it might be worth contacting the guys who gave the talk to see if I could get access if I really needed to.
