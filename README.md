# cloud-fyp

This project is my final year project for a computer science degree in University College Cork.

The idea is to implement an automated system for deploying and monitoring cloud instances across multiple different cloud platforms. 

The initial plan is to have 1 Paas 1 Iaas and 1 Saas service fully automated across AWS and an OpenStack instance. This may increase to an extra Paas or Iaas later on depending on time.

The work will involve the use and possible development on Apache libCloud as well as work with the Boto python library. 

The work will be done with in python. 

First order of business is to make up a CLI interface to deploy and monitor instances and later to develop dash boards that allow you to do the same or at least monitor. 

Some possible offshoots or future work given time are:
1) Develop a predictive usage system
2) Give price comparsion across cloud platforms
3) Allow for redeployment from one cloud platfrom to another
